# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please responsibly disclose security issues by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainers directly. If you need an email contact, consider adding an `SECURITY_CONTACT` in the future.

## Recommended Practices

- Only deploy audited contract code to mainnet.
- Run extensive tests for edge cases (concurrent auctions, failed transfers, refunds).
- Perform a formal audit for contracts before handling production funds.

## Disclosure timeline

We recommend giving maintainers at least 90 days to respond and fix critical vulnerabilities before public disclosure.
