# BlindBid Protocol 🚀

**A blind vault-based NFT auction protocol** — combines on-chain vaults with blind, fixed-increment bidding to enable NFT sellers to create vaults (bundles of NFTs) and run auctions securely.

---

## 🔍 Overview

BlindBid Protocol lets creators bundle NFTs into a vault, verify metadata and basic ownership off-chain, then run blind auctions on-chain using the `VaultAuction` contract. This repo contains:

- `contracts/` — Solidity contracts (VaultAuction, MonkeyNFT), tests and deployment scripts.
- `backend/` — lightweight Node/Express API for NFT verification, indexing and valuation used by the UI.
- `frontend/` — React + Vite + wagmi UI that interacts with the smart contracts and the backend verification API.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Smart contracts: Solidity (Hardhat)
- Backend: Node.js (Express), ethers
- Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScript, wagmi, viem
- Tests: Hardhat test suite (Mocha/Chai)

---

## ✅ Features

- Vault creation (bundle multiple ERC-721 tokens)
- Create and start auctions for vaults
- Blind bidding model with fixed bid increment (0.1 ETH)
- Off-chain verification for NFTs (rarity, value estimate, mint risk)
- Frontend flow for verifying, approving, creating vaults, and starting auctions

## 🛠️ Getting Started (local)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm or yarn (or bun)
- Hardhat and related packages are installed per `contracts/package.json` when you run `npm install` inside `contracts/`.

### Quick start (recommended order)

1. Clone repo

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd blindbid-protocol
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   # backend
   cd backend && npm install

   # contracts
   cd ../contracts && npm install

   # frontend
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

3. Start a local node (e.g., Hardhat)

   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat node
   ```

4. Deploy contracts to local node

   ```bash
   cd contracts
   DEPLOY_NETWORK=local node scripts/deploy.cjs
   ```

5. Start backend

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   # create .env with required values (see backend/README.md)
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Start frontend

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   # create .env with VITE_API_BASE_URL pointing at backend (e.g. http://localhost:3001)
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

- Contracts
  ```bash
  cd contracts
  npm test
  ```

- Backend & Frontend
  - Unit tests are minimal in this repo; the primary behavior is covered by the smart contract tests.

## 🧭 Architecture & Design Notes

- Vaults: on-chain container storing multiple ERC-721 NFTs. The contract transfers NFTs into the vault on `createVault`.
- Auctions: Once an auction is created and started, bidders submit fixed +0.1 ETH increments; previous bid is refunded to the previous highest bidder.
- Off-chain verification: The backend examines NFT metadata and on-chain information to produce a verification result used by the frontend before creating a vault (helps mitigate fresh-mint risk).
